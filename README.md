#### auto generate getters and setters in intellij IDEA
   In java world , we often need to write some code that not really not about the business, for example :
   - getter and setter 
   - toString
   - equals

   In some class with lots of DAO, this is pretty annoying in case of many properties. 
   You can choose the code, then right click -> generate -> getter and setter/ clone /equals / hashCode/toString , -> Boom
